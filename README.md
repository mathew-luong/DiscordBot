# DiscordBot
 
StudyBot is a discord bot created for helping you and your friends stay productive and on top of your work. It was originally created for myself to keep me focused on work whenever I found myself getting distracted on Discord, so what better fix than to make a productivity bot right inside Discord!

It includes features such as creating a reminder, reminding other users on the server, starting a study session, creating flashcards, polls, todo lists, and private study rooms. 

It was built with the PyCord Discord API wrapper.
